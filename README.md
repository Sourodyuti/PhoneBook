**PhoneBook** is a sleek and modern phonebook application designed to manage contacts with ease. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a minimalist white-themed UI, responsive design, and interactive elements powered by Anime.js. Contacts are stored persistently using localStorage, and the app supports adding, searching, and deleting contacts with a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Search Contacts**: Search by name or number using a single input field with real-time filtering.
- **Delete Contacts**: Remove individual contacts with a dedicated delete button per contact card.
- **Persistent Storage**: Contacts are saved to localStorage, ensuring data persists across browser sessions.
- **Interactive UI**: 3D tilt effects on buttons, hover animations on contact cards, and smooth Anime.js transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard support (Enter key for form submission) for improved accessibility.
